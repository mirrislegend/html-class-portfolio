<h1>The Best Movies According to Aaron</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h2>The Matrix</h2>
<p>The breakout scifi movie of the new millenium.</p>
<h2>The Nightmare Before Christmas</h2>
<p>Anti-hero lead, stop-motion animation, and a plot full of subversion of expectations. What's not to love?</p>
<h2>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</h2>
<p>The lords of absurdist humor are at it again. Truly this is tied with Life of Brian. Both are masterpieces.</p>
